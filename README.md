# MIND-DRIVEN-GAMING-USING-EEG-BASED-BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE
Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) represent a revolutionary step toward merging human 
cognition with digital systems, allowing users to control applications using their brain 
activity instead of physical input devices. This project focuses on developing a contactless 
and intuitive gaming environment driven by Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. 
EEG captures the brain’s electrical activity through sensors placed on the scalp, providing 
real-time insights into mental states such as focus, relaxation, and cognitive load. 
 
The proposed system collects and processes EEG data to identify distinct mental patterns 
associated with user intentions. Using advanced signal processing techniques such as 
filtering, artifact removal, and feature extraction (including power spectral density and 
frequency band analysis), the data is preprocessed for classification. The refined EEG 
features are then fed into machine learning algorithms—specifically K-Nearest 
Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Neural Network 
(DNN) models—to accurately map brainwave activity to game control commands. 
 
A real-time interface was developed where players can perform actions such as 
movement or selection purely through mental focus or relaxation levels. The trained 
models achieved an accuracy of up to 80%, validating the feasibility of using BCIs for 
interactive and immersive gaming experiences. 
 
Beyond entertainment, this research highlights the potential of BCIs in assistive 
technologies, offering new possibilities for individuals with motor disabilities to engage 
in virtual environments or control digital systems effortlessly. The integration of 
neuroscience, machine learning, and human-computer interaction in this project 
demonstrates the transformative potential of thought-driven interfaces in the future of 
gaming and accessibility
